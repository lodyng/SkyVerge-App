				<li>Where are you located? <br>
			I am located in North Florida </li> <br>
			
			<li>Why are you looking for a new position? <br>
			I am looking for a more challenging position that allows me to be involved in several aspects and take advantage of my technical aptitude.</li> <br>
			
			<li>Can you summarize your remote work experience? <br>
			In my first remote position I worked as an independent contractor placing restaurant orders for customers. This job required focus and discipline as you are constantly bidding against other workers for orders.
			In my most recent remote position I interacted with customers through chat, email and over the phone to provide customer and administrative support as well as technical troubleshooting on the site. Along with these job functions I was required to analyze my customer interactions to seek if/where improvement could be made. </li> <br>

			<li>What should we definitely look at in your resume/work experience? <br>
			I feel that my transition into the hotel and hospitality industry should definitely be noted because I was given an opportunity and even though I had no prior experience I was able to thrive and succeed for the past six years.</li> <br>

			<li>What’s not on your resume/work experience but you think we should know? <br>
			I’d like you to know how tenacious and devoted I am towards excelling at any given task. I believe an integral part of that is to share knowledge and lend a helping hand whenever possible as you will likely receive the same when in need. I have impeccable time management and detest being late or feeling as though I am not living up to my potential. If there is any job role or function that I am not already proficient in I will work diligently to become so. </li> <br>

			<li>Can you summarize your HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge? <br>
			As a self-taught programmer, I not only enjoy learning new things but strive to constantly develop my skills and knowledge. I believe technology is the future and seek to use it positively and productively. I am an organized and meticulous worker who is proficient and knowledgeable in web development, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, has a knack for problem solving, impeccable writing skills and is aware of the dedication required to work remotely. </li> <br>

			<li>Why do you think you’re a good fit for this role? <br>
			My administrative organization, customer support experience and technical aptitude make me a fitting candidate for this position. I truly enjoy speaking with customers and ensuring that they are being provided with exceptional service and a positive experience. </li> <br>

			<li>Anything else we should know about you? <br>
			The entirety of my work history has been centered on customer support and providing guests with an amazing experience in an absolute professional manner. Communication has never been a problem for me; I have the empathy and patience needed to assist upset or confused customers. I possess the discipline to work remotely from home as this is something that I am already familiar with and has strengthened my propensity to complete work independently as well as be a supportive team player. </li> <br>
