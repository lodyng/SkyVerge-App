			<h3>Pre-Sales</h3>
			<p>Unfortunately we do not yet allow live image previews but we hope to in the near future. I apologize for any inconvenience and if you would like I can contact you as soon as this feature does becomes available at SkyVerge.</p>
			
			<h3>Fire Alarm</h3>
			<p>I would first read through a few of the emails to inform myself on what issue the customers are having, whether or not they are all having the same issue or if there are various issues and any additional information I can quickly gather. I would then contact the appropriate department, e.g. engineering team, product team, etc., to inquire on any solutions that they are currently working on so that I can then return emails to the distraught customers providing them with an update of what is happening and possibly a time frame on when the issue will be resolved.</p>
			
			<h3>Step-by-Step</h3>
			<p>The last thing that I purchased was a pair of jeans. I began by entering the website name in the search bar, www.websitename.com. I then clicked on the navigation icon in the top-left corner and selected jeans from the menu. Once on the jeans page I searched through the pages of available items and chose “Select” when I found the style that I liked. After selecting the style, I chose my size and selected “Add to Cart”. I clicked on the shopping cart icon at the top of the page and that brought me to my order where I was then prompted to enter my payment information. Once I entered my payment information and selected “Purchase” I was taken to a confirmation page for my order.</p>
